## Description

The SafariDialog module provides Titanium access to the native SFSafariViewController. This enables you to 
deliver interactive web content in your app just like Safari, including the key Safari UI elements already 
familiar to your users. See how to easily bring Safari features like Reader and AutoFill into your app.

For usage see the code in [app.js in the example folder](example/app.js)
